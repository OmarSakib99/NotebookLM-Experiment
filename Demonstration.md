## Practical Demonstrations

For the 3 demonstrations, we will be using study materials from statistics for business and finance courses, along with two other materials: one from YouTube and the other from a website. The topic we chose is **two-mean hypothesis testing**.

This is the interface of NotebookLM, and from there we can observe the following:

1) **Sources**:  
   You can add different kinds of sources, such as Google Drive, files from your computer, website links (including class recordings), or directly pasted text. You can even add transcripts here.

2) **Suggestions**:  
   NotebookLM provides suggestions like creating a briefing document that aggregates data from all the sources.

3) **Basic Summary**:  
   A summary is auto-generated by NotebookLM based on the sources provided.

4) **Question Suggestions**:  
   NotebookLM also suggests questions you can ask based on the content provided.

5) **Podcast Generation**:  
   One of the unique features is generating an audio podcast based on the sources.

### Functions Demonstration

- **Summary**:  
  A summary is automatically generated by NotebookLM, as shown in point 3 above.

- **Question-Answer Session**:  
  Let's take an example from the suggested questions. In the response, if you see numbers, you can touch them to view the exact source from where the information was pulled. This is useful to ensure accuracy and avoid hallucinations, which can happen in AI models like ChatGPT. If you want to ask the next question based solely on a specific source (like a PDF), you can untick the other sources and proceed.

- **Suggested Ideas**:  
  This helps identify ideas you might have missed. By selecting a note, NotebookLM will suggest related ideas based on the content.

- **Podcast Generation**:  
  You can create a custom podcast by asking questions like, "Why do we use two-mean hypothesis testing?" This will prompt NotebookLM to generate a podcast, usually featuring two hosts, and lasting around 10 to 20 minutes.
