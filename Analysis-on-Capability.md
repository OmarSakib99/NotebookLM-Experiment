# Accuracy

In terms of accuracy, NotebookLM performs well as it pulls information directly from the data source and even provides reference numbers to show exactly where the data came from. This feature helps reduce AI hallucinations. To get precise answers, you need to ask clear and specific questions. For instance, if we select option three from the picture on the left, it opens the source and shows exactly where the information was generated from.

# Effectiveness

NotebookLM is somewhat effective in extracting information from the provided sources and delivering accurate answers. However, if the question extends beyond the available sources, the tool doesn't delve deep into explanations. That being said, NotebookLM does inform the user when it can't fully answer the question. For example, I asked how to find a critical value in Excel, which wasn't covered in any of the provided sources, and it indicated that the information was missing.

# Strengths

The primary strength of NotebookLM lies in its ability to save students time by simplifying large amounts of information into digestible summaries. It helps students focus on the points they want to learn, preventing cognitive overload. Additionally, it allows students to review multiple materials simultaneously. The podcast feature sounds eerily realistic, mimicking a natural conversation between two people, making it hard to distinguish from a real podcast.

# Weaknesses

- **Navigability**: One drawback is that transitioning between different functions (e.g., from the question-and-answer section to creating a podcast or viewing the summary) isn't intuitive. After finishing with a question, it was challenging to find my way back to other features until I noticed the Notebook Guide button on the side. It takes some time to get accustomed to NotebookLM and its interface.

- **Information Gaps**: At times, the notes generated might not provide enough information to fully answer a question, leaving the user still confused and needing additional information.
  
- **Paywalled Content**: NotebookLM cannot access or read from websites that are behind a paywall.

# Conclusion

NotebookLM can serve as a helpful study companion for students, allowing them to ask questions and receive basic answers. However, for more detailed and curated responses beyond the provided sources, students may still need to consult their instructors.
